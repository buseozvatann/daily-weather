It is a 7 days weather forecast website that is displayed with the data from the site that name 'openweathermap.org'.

I'm using city coordinates for weather data from the one call api.

I use bootstrap for the responsive design.

**Please Note:**

_If you want to try my code you have to **sign up the openweathermap.org** and **you take a special API_KEY**._

```
API_ROOT='https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5';
API_KEY= 'your special api key';
```
